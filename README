It is a project to try out Prototype and Script.aculo.us.

It is a copy of calendar widget in Windows 7.

Backlog:
- go to higher level
	- shrink current grid
	- shrink replacing grid
- drill down
- tune animation
	title change animation

Currently this project is terminated. Not cancelled, but terminated because I am not going to return back to it in the future. I've terminated this project because I see no value in it. I've learned a little bit Javascript but developing calendar widget isn't fun anymore so I won't force myself.
